    "Computers are now able to process images automatically. We see this in apps like SnapChat that can automatically detect where our face is in the image. In this lesson, we'll learn about how **image processing** works at a basic level.\n",

    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go back to features, which we talked about earlier. Remember our Spotify exercise in Day 1? We saw that for songs, features included things like loudness, acousticness, tempo, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Features** are also very important in image processing, to be able to simplify a complex image (say, of 200x200 pixels = 40,000 data points) into its most characteristic form (maybe 20 points.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Corners** have traditionally been a popular type of feature in computer vision. Let's see an example of how this works. \n",

    "Do a google search for [Picasso's Bulls](https://www.google.ca/search?q=picasso%27s+bulls&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj43cOdiODbAhU_IjQIHQaxDawQ_AUICSgA&biw=1264&bih=799&dpr=1) and notice how we are able to recognize this animal with just a few lines and crossings arranged in a certain way. Other visual features used in Computer Vision include edges, corners, and blobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing machine learning, we need to perform **feature extraction**, to convert an image into a set of features. This is a big topic and we will just cover the basics here of image representation and processing here. But the pipeline usually works like this:\n",
    "\n",

    "## Image Processing Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it helps to understand how an picture is represented on a computer.\n",
    "The basic datastructure for this is a 2-dimensional array of a certain width and height, where color values are stored for each point on a grid of (x,y) positions. These points that a picture is made of are called pixels (short form of \"picture element\").\n",
    "Each pixel in a picture has three values to describe a mixture or red, green, blue (RGB for short) that make up a colour. "
